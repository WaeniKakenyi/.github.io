**1. Git vs Github**

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is designed to handle projects irrespective of the size, with speed and efficiency. It is also defined as a version control system that records different version of a file. It lets users access, compare, update and distribute any of the recorded versions at any time.

Github is an online (web-based) platform where users can host Git repositories. It helps facilitate easy sharing and collaboration on projects with people anytime. It also encourages broader participation on open-source projects by providing a secure way to edit files in another user's repository.

**2. What is version control?**

Version Control is a method used to save a files version for future references.
Version control allows for keeping track of work and helps in exploring changes made. It helps with the collaboration of projects with different people.

**3. What is Git pages?**

GitHub paages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Its purpose is to provide the GitHub user a way to create personal websites for themselves and websites for their projects / repositories.

**1. Microcontollers vs mocroprocessors**

Microcontrollers also called MCUs are a single Integrated Circuit (IC) that is typically used for a specific application and designed to implement certain tasks.Essentially, a microcontroller gathers input, processes this information, and outputs a certain action based on the information gathered.

Microprocessors are an electronic component that is used by a computer to do its work. It only consists of a CPU.They are used in personal computers.
