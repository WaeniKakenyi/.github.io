**1. Git vs Github**

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is designed to handle projects irrespective of the size, with speed and efficiency. It is also defined as a version control system that records different version of a file. It lets users access, compare, update and distribute any of the recorded versions at any time.

Github is an online (web-based) platform where users can host Git repositories. It helps facilitate easy sharing and collaboration on projects with people anytime. It also encourages broader participation on open-source projects by providing a secure way to edit files in another user's repository.

**2. What is version control?**

Version Control is a method used to save a files version for future references.
Version control allows for keeping track of work and helps in exploring changes made. It helps with the collaboration of projects with different people.

**3. What is Git pages?**

GitHub paages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Its purpose is to provide the GitHub user a way to create personal websites for themselves and websites for their projects / repositories.

**1. Microcontollers vs mocroprocessors**

Microcontrollers also called MCUs are a single Integrated Circuit (IC) that is typically used for a specific application and designed to implement certain tasks.Essentially, a microcontroller gathers input, processes this information, and outputs a certain action based on the information gathered.

Microprocessors are an electronic component that is used by a computer to do its work. It only consists of a CPU.They are used in personal computers.

## [2 Factor Authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication)
**1. What**

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With 2FA, you have to log in with your username and password and provide another form of authentication that only you know or have access to.


**2. Why**

This provides an additional security to your account.

**3. How**

With 2FA enabled, you'll be asked to provide your 2FA authentication code, as well as your password, when you sign in to GitHub.

After you sign in to GitHub using your password, you'll be prompted to provide an authentication code from a text message (SMS) or your TOTP app.

After you configure 2FA using a mobile app or via text message, you can add a security key, like a fingerprint reader or Windows Hello. The technology that enables authentication with a security key is called WebAuthn. WebAuthn is the successor to U2F and works in all modern browsers.

GitHub will only ask you to provide your 2FA authentication code again if you've logged out, are using a new device, or your session expires.

**4. Who**

It is strongly adviced to enable this for all websites and applications that support 2FA.

**5. Types**

i. Providing a 2FA code when signing in to the website

Generating a code through a TOTP application

Receiving a text message

Using two-factor authentication with the command line

ii. Authenticating on the command line using HTTPS

Authenticating on the command line using SSH

iii. Using two-factor authentication to access a repository using Subversion


**6. Where**

## Iot Communication Protocols
**[Types](https://www.avsystem.com/blog/iot-protocols-and-standards/)**
1. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
2. ZigBee
3. Bluetooth
4. Extensible(XMPP)
5. Data-Distribution Service (DDS)
6. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
7. Lighweight M2M (LwM2M)
8. WiFi

## [OSI Model](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/osi-model)

The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software. In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing syhis istem are split into seven different abstraction layers: 
1. Physical layer

This is the lowest layer of the OSI model. It is concerned with electrically or optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of the receiving device. 

It can include specifications such as voltages, pin layout, cabling, and radio frequencies. At the physical layer, one might find “physical” resources such as network hubs, cabling, repeaters, network adapters or modems.

3. Data Link Layer

At the data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical layer.

The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The first, media access control (MAC), provides flow control and multiplexing for device transmissions over a network. The second, the logical link control (LLC), provides flow and error control over the physical medium as well as identifies line protocols.

4. Network Layer

The network layer is responsible for receiving frames from the data link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among based on the addresses contained inside the frame. The network layer finds the destination by using logical addresses, such as IP (internet protocol). At this layer, routers are a crucial component used to quite literally route information where it needs to go between networks.

5. Transport Layer

The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of the transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol.

6. Session Layer

The session layer controls the conversations between different computers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed, and termined at layer 5. Session layer services also include authentication and reconnections.

7. Presentation Layer

The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts. Because of this, it at times also called the syntax layer. This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the application layer.

8. Application Layer

At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application. This layer sees network services provided to end-user applications such as a web browser or Office 365. The application layer identifies communication partners, resource availability, and synchronizes communication.

## Telecommunication

1. Aerial mobile mapping
2. Emergency response planning
3. Internet applications

**SMS Mapping**


## [GSM vs GPRS](geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-gsm-and-gprs/)

**GSM(Global Systems for Mobile)** is a cellular standard for mobile phone communications to cater to voice services and data delivery using digital modulation. It is the standard-bearer of the 2G technologies. GSM is a circuit-switched network. It does not allow direct connection to the internet. SMS (Short Messaging Service) is one of the popular features. It is used in almost all countries and provides its services to a large set of users.

**GPRS(General Packet Radio Service)** is an up-gradation of GSM features over the basic features to obtain much higher data speeds and simple wireless access to packet data networks than standard GSM. It is the standard-bearer of the 2.5G technologies. GPRS is a packet-switched network. In GPRS, billing is based on the amount of data transferred. It allows direct connection to the internet. MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) is one of the popular features. It can not be offered to all countries as it is confined to developed areas with a proper network connection.
